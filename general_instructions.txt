Get maximum help only from the Internet. Avoid seeking help from friends and seniors.

Don't get to know what your friend's task is, even though you already have their instructions with you.

In the next level of assessment, you will be asked to integrate the 6 tasks into a single application. So don't overdo your job now. If you do, it will be a negative remark.

Try to write flexible and robust code as much as possible.

Name all the files, folders, classes, variables, functions, etc elegantly. Eg. Avoid names such as $a, class x, etc.

Provide Comments wherever necessary.

Create your files/directories only within the directory with your name. Respect the privacy of others.

Strictly do not create files/folders in the root path (i.e. /ameexphpassessment/) or in other user's folders.

Use the Bootstrap Framework (already included in your index.php) to the maximum extent possible. 

Do not create/write your own CSS files.

Place all javascript code in a seperate file and include it.

Additional points for building a Single Page Application.

Since you are working in a shared database, respect other's data. Update/Delete only the rows inserted by you. Never try drop or delete table queries.
