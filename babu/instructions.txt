General Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a User Registration Form.
Form should contain 2 sections with the following fields
	1. Account Information
		(i) 	User Name
		(ii)	Password
		(iii)	Confirm Password
	2. Profile Information
		(i)		First Name
		(ii)	Last Name
		(iii)	Phone Number
		(iv)	Email Address
All fields must be validated on Client Side & Server Side. Especially Phone Number & Email Address.
Store only the encrypted Passwords in Database using an encryption method.
User Name must be validated against database & Duplicate User Names should not be allowed


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DB Structure & Configuration
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use only the tables provided below for processing. The Tables & Columns are
	1. ameex_user
		(i)		uid
		(ii)	name
		(iii)	pass
	2. ameex_user_profile
		(i)		uid
		(ii)	first_name
		(iii)	last_name
		(iv)	mail
		(v)		phone
The column uid in table ameex_user is the primary key and will be incremented automatically.
Do not insert values for uid in the table ameex_user is insert query. uid should be used only when updating this table.
Whereas uid in ameex_user_profile is the foreign key from the table ameex_user. Hence uid should always be used in where clause when inserting values to this table.
The Database is already connected. Always include "http://irwinner.in/ameexphpassessment/secure/dbconfig.php" in the files you will use dbquery.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PHP Programming
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Implement the following Interfaces (Interface -> Class)
	1. formItemInterface	-> formItem
	2. userInterface		-> user
	3. userProfileInterface	-> userProfile
Implement the classes in the file interface.php (ameexphpassessment/babu/interface.php)
The input elements in the form should be rendered using the formItem->render function only. <input> tag should not be hardcoded in any other files.
Once the User Registration Form passes validation and is submitted, SESSION should be created and uid should be stored in SESSION.
If SESSION is set, 
	Display the User Profile Information (along with UID and User Name) and Provide a button to allow Editing.
	On clicking Edit button, a form should open to allow Editing the details. 
	The values in the form should be built using an instance of the classes user and userProfile.
If SESSION is not set,
	Display Registration Form
	Provide a login button to access Login Form
	Login Form should contain 2 form items (User Name & Password).
	On successful validation, SESSION should be set
When user is logged in provide a Logout button/link and destroy the SESSION when clicked.
